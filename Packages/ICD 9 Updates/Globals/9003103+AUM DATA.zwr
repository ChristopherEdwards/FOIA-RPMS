Risks include malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies and is generally reserved for people who have a body mass index greater than 50.|c. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). A surgical procedure where an inflatable band is placed around the uppermost part of the stomach. When the band is inflated, it compresses the stomach, acting like a belt that tightens. The band can be adjusted so that it restricts more or less food. It may lead to less weight loss than other procedures, and may need band adjustment periodically.|d. Vertical banded gastroplasty. This procedure, also called stomach stapling, divides the stomach into two parts, restricting how much food can be eaten. The upper pouch is small and empties into the lower pouch of the stomach.

Fever, malaise, fatigue, cough and mild chest discomfort progresses to severe respiratory distress with dyspnea, diaphoresis, stridor, cyanosis, and shock. Death typically occurs within 24-36 hours after onset of severe symptoms. Anthrax presents three somewhat distinct clinical syndromes in humans: cutaneous, inhalational, and gastrointestinal disease. The cutaneous form (also referred to as a malignant pustule) occurs most frequently on the hands and forearms of persons working with infected livestock. It begins as a papule followed by formation of a fluid-filled vesicle. The vesicle typically dries and forms a coal-black scab (eschar), hence the term anthrax (from the Greek for coal). This local infection can occasionally disseminate into a fatal systemic infection. Gastrointestinal anthrax is rare in humans and is contracted by the ingestion of insufficiently cooked meat from infected animals. Endemic inhalational anthrax, known as Woolsorters' disease, is also a rare infection contracted by inhalation of the spores. It occurs mainly among workers in an industrial setting.|b.Brucellosis: Brucellosis has a low mortality rate (5% of untreated cases), with rare deaths caused by endocarditis or meningitis. Also, given that the disease has a relatively long and variable incubation period (5-60 days), and that many naturally occurring infections are asymptomatic, its usefulness as a weapon may be diminished. Large aerosol doses, however, may shorten the incubation period and increase the clinical attack rate, and the disease is relatively prolonged, incapacitating, and disabling in its natural form. Brucellosis, also known as undulant fever,"" typically presents as a nonspecific febrile illness resembling influenza. Fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, back pain, sweats, chills, generalized weakness, and malaise are common complaints. Cough and pleuritic chest pain occurs in up to 20 percent of cases, but acute pneumonitis is unusual, and pulmonary symptoms may not correlate with radiographic findings. The chest x-ray is often normal, but may show lung abscesses, single or miliary nodules, bronchopneumonia, enlarged hilar lymph nodes, and pleural effusions. Gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation) occur in up to 70 percent of adult cases, but less frequently in children. Ileitis, colitis, and granulomatous or mononuclear infiltrative hepatitis may occur, with hepato- and splenomegaly present in 45-63 percent of cases. Lumbar pain and tenderness can occur in up to 60% of brucellosis cases and are sometimes due to various osteoarticular infections of the axial skeleton. Vertebral osteomyelitis, intervertebral disc space infection, paravertebral abscess, and sacroiliac infection occur in a minority of cases, but may be a cause of chronic symptoms. Consequently, persistent fever following therapy or the prolonged presence of significant musculoskeletal complaints should prompt CT or MR imaging. 99m Technetium and 67 Gallium scans are also reasonably sensitive means for detecting sacroiliitis and other axial skeletal infections. Joint involvement in brucellosis may vary from pain to joint immobility and effusion. While the sacroiliac joints are most commonly involved, peripheral joints (notably, hips, knees, and ankles) may also be affected. Meningitis complicates a small minority of brucellosis cases, and encephalitis, peripheral neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy and meningovascular syndromes have also been observed in rare instances. Behavioral disturbances and psychoses appear to occur out of proportion to the height of fever, or to the amount of overt CNS disease. This raises questions about an ill-defined neurotoxic component of brucellosis.|c.Glanders and Melioidosis: Incubation period ranges from 10-14 days after inhalation. Onset of symptoms may be abrupt or gradual. Inhalational exposure produces fever (common in excess of 102F), rigors, sweats, myalgias, headache, pleuritic chest pain, cervical adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and generalized papular / pustular eruptions. Acute pulmonary disease can progress and result in bacteremia and acute septicemic disease. Both diseases are almost always fatal without treatment. Both glanders and melioidosis may occur in an acute localized form, as an acute pulmonary infection, or as an acute fulminant, rapidly fatal, sepsis. Combinations of these syndromes may occur in human cases. Also, melioidosis may remain asymptomatic after initial acquisition, and remain quiescent for decades. However, these patients may present with active melioidosis years later, often associated with an immune-compromising state. Aerosol infection produced by a BW weapon containing either B. mallei or B. pseudomallei could produce any of these syndromes. The incubation period ranges from 10-14 days, depending on the inhaled dose and agent virulence. The septicemic form begins suddenly with fever, rigors, sweats, myalgias, pleuritic chest pain, granulomatous or necrotizing lesions, generalized erythroderma, jaundice, photophobia, lacrimation, and diarrhea. Physical examination may reveal fever, tachycardia, cervical adenopathy and mild hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Blood cultures are usually negative until the patient is moribund. Mild leukocytosis with a shift to the left or leukopenia may occur. The pulmonary form may follow inhalation or arise by hematogenous spread. Systemic symptoms as described for the septicemic form occur. Chest radiographs may show miliary nodules (0.5-1.0 cm) and/or a bilateral bronchopneumonia, segmental, or lobar pneumonia, consolidation, and cavitating lung lesions. Acute infection of the oral, nasal, and/ or conjunctival mucosa can cause mucopurulent, blood-streaked discharge from the nose, associated with septal and turbinate nodules and ulcerations. If systemic invasion occurs from mucosal or cutaneous lesions then a papular and / or pustular rash may occur that can be mistaken for smallpox (another possible BW agent). Evidence of dissemination of these infections includes the presence of skin pustules, abscesses of internal organs, such as liver and spleen, and multiple pulmonary lesions. This form carries a high mortality, and most patients develop rapidly progressive septic shock. The chronic form is unlikely to be present within 14 days after a BW aerosol attack. It is characterized by cutaneous and intramuscular abscesses on the legs and arms. These lesions are associated with enlargement and induration of the regional lymph channels and nodes. The chronic form may be asymptomatic, especially with melioidosis. There have been cases associated with the development of steomyelitis, brain abscess, and meningitis.|d.Plague: Pneumonic plague begins after an incubation period of 1-6 days, with high fever, chills, headache, malaise, followed by cough (often with hemoptysis), progressing rapidly to dyspnea, stridor, cyanosis, and death. Gastrointestinal symptoms are often present. Death results from respiratory failure, circulatory collapse, and a bleeding diathesis. Bubonic plague, featuring high fever, malaise, and painful lymph nodes (buboes) may progress spontaneously to the septicemic form (septic shock, thrombosis, DIC) or to the pneumonic form. Plague normally appears in three forms in man: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The bubonic form begins after an incubation period of 2-10 days, with acute and fulminant onset of nonspecific symptoms, including high fever, malaise, headache, myalgias, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. Up to half of patients will have abdominal pain. Simultaneous with or shortly after the onset of these nonspecific symptoms, the bubo develops - a swollen, very painful, infected lymph node. Buboes are normally seen in the femoral or inguinal lymph nodes as the legs are the most commonly flea-bitten part of the adult human body. The liver and spleen are often tender and palpable. One quarter of patients will have various types of skin lesions: a pustule, vesicle, eschar or papule (containing leukocytes and bacteria) in the lymphatic drainage of the bubo, and presumably representing the site of the inoculating flea bite. Secondary septicemia is common, as greater than 80 percent of blood cultures are positive for the organism in patients with bubonic plague. However, only about a quarter of bubonic plague patients progress to clinical septicemia. In those that do progress to secondary septicemia, as well as those presenting septicemic but without lymphadenopathy (primary septicemia), the symptoms are similar to other Gram-negative septicemias: high fever, chills, malaise, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, plague septicemia can also produce thromboses in the acral vessels, with necrosis and gangrene, and DIC. Black necrotic appendages and more proximal purpuric lesions caused by endotoxemia are often present. Organisms can spread to the central nervous system, lungs, and elsewhere. Plague meningitis occurs in about 6% of septicemic and pneumonic cases. Pneumonic plague is an infection of the lungs due to either inhalation of the organisms (primary pneumonic plague), or spread to the lungs from septicemia (secondary pneumonic plague). After an incubation period varying from 1 to 6 days for primary pneumonic plague (usually 2-4 days, and presumably dose-dependent), onset is acute and often fulminant. The first signs of illness include high fever, chills, headache, malaise, and myalgias, followed within 24 hours by a cough with bloody sputum. Although bloody sputum is characteristic, it can sometimes be watery or, less commonly, purulent. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, may be present. Rarely, a cervical bubo might result from an inhalational exposure. The chest X-ray findings are variable, but most commonly reveal bilateral infiltrates, which may be patchy or consolidated. The pneumonia progresses rapidly, resulting in dyspnea, stridor, and cyanosis. The disease terminates with respiratory failure, and circulatory collapse. Nonspecific laboratory findings include a leukocytosis, with a total WBC count up to 20,000 cells with increased bands, and greater than 80 percent polymorphonuclear cells. One also often finds increased fibrin split products in the blood indicative of a low-grade DIC. The BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, and bilirubin may also be elevated, consistent with multi-organ failure. In man, the mortality of untreated bubonic plague is approximately 60 percent (reduced to <5% with prompt effective therapy), whereas in untreated pneumonic plague the mortality rate is nearly 100 percent, and survival is unlikely if treatment is delayed beyond 18 hours of infection. In the U.S. in the past 50 years, 4 of the 7 pneumonic plague patients (57%) died. Recent data from the ongoing Madagascar epidemic, which began in 1989, corroborate that figure; the mortality associated with respiratory involvement was 57%, while that for bubonic plague was 15%.|e.Q-Fever: Fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain may occur as early as ten days after exposure. Patients are not generally critically ill, and the illness lasts from 2 days to 2 weeks. Following the usual incubation period of 2-14 days, Q fever generally occurs as a self-limiting febrile illness lasting 2 days to 2 weeks. The incubation period varies according to the numbers of organisms inhaled, with longer periods between exposure and illness with lower numbers of inhaled organisms (up to forty days in some cases). The disease generally presents as an acute non-differentiated febrile illness, with headaches, fatigue, and myalgias as prominent symptoms. Physical examination of the chest is usually normal. Pneumonia, manifested by an abnormal chest x-ray, occurs in half of all patients, but only around half of these, or 28 percent of patients, will have a cough (usually non-productive) or rales. Pleuritic chest pain occurs in about one-fourth of patients with Q fever pneumonia. Chest radiograph abnormalities, when present, are patchy infiltrates that may resemble viral or mycoplasma pneumonia. Rounded opacities and adenopathy have also been described. Approximately 33 percent of Q fever cases will develop acute hepatitis. This can present with fever and abnormal liver function tests with the absence of pulmonary signs and symptoms. Uncommon complications include chronic hepatitis, culture-negative endocarditis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and osteomyelitis. Most patients who develop endocarditis have pre-existing valvular heart disease.|f.Tularemia: Ulceroglandular tularemia presents with a local ulcer and regional lymphadenopathy, fever, chills, headache and malaise. Typhoidal tularemia presents with fever, headache, malaise, substernal discomfort, prostration, weight loss and a non-productive cough. After an incubation period varying from 1-21 days (average 3-5 days), presumably dependent upon the dose of organisms, onset is usually acute. Tularemia typically appears in one of six forms in man depending upon the route of inoculation: typhoidal, ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, and pneumonic tularemia. In humans, as few as 10 to 50 organisms will cause disease if inhaled or injected intradermally, whereas approximately 10 organisms are required with oral challenge. Typhoidal tularemia (5-15 percent of naturally acquired cases) occurs mainly after inhalation of infectious aerosols, but can occur after intradermal or gastrointestinal challenge. F. tularensis would presumably be most likely delivered by aerosol in a BW attack and would primarily cause typhoidal tularemia. It manifests as fever, prostration, and weight loss, but unlike most other forms of the disease, presents without lymphadenopathy. Pneumonia may be severe and fulminant and can be associated with any form of tularemia (30% of ulceroglandular cases), but it is most common in typhoidal tularemia (80% of cases). Respiratory symptoms, substernal discomfort, and a cough (productive and non-productive) may also be present. Case fatality rates following a BW attack may be greater than the 1-3 % seen with appropriately treated natural disease. Case fatality rates are about 35% in untreated naturally acquired typhoidal cases. Ulceroglandular tularemia (75-85 percent of cases) is most often acquired through inoculation of the skin or mucous membranes with blood or tissue fluids of infected animals. It is characterized by fever, chills, headache, malaise, an ulcerated skin lesion, and painful regional lymphadenopathy. The skin lesion is usually located on the fingers or hand where contact occurs. Glandular tularemia (5-10 percent of cases) results in fever and tender lymphadenopathy but no skin ulcer. Oculoglandular tularemia (1-2 percent of cases) occurs after inoculation of the conjunctivae by contaminated hands, splattering of infected tissue fluids, or by aerosols. Patients have unilateral, painful, purulent conjunctivitis with preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Chemosis, periorbital edema, and small nodular lesions or ulcerations of the palpebral conjunctiva are noted in some patients. Oropharyngeal tularemia refers to primary ulceroglandular disease confined to the throat. It produces an acute exudative or membranous pharyngotonsillitis with cervical lymphadenopathy. Pneumonic tularemia is a severe atypical pneumonia that may be fulminant and with a high case fatality rate if untreated. It can be primary following inhalation of organisms or secondary following hematogenous / septicemic spread. It is seen in 30-80 percent of the typhoidal cases and in 10-15 percent of the ulceroglandular cases. The case fatality rate without treatment is approximately 5 percent for the ulceroglandular form and 35 percent for the typhoidal form. All ages are susceptible, and recovery is generally followed by permanent immunity.|g.Smallpox: Clinical manifestations begin acutely with malaise, fever, rigors, vomiting, headache, and backache. 2-3 days later lesions appear which quickly progress from macules to papules, and eventually to pustular vesicles. They are more abundant on the extremities and face, and develop synchronously. The incubation period of smallpox averaged 12 days, although it could range from 7-19 days following exposure. Clinical manifestations begin acutely with malaise, fever, rigors, vomiting, headache, and backache; 15% of patients developed delirium. Approximately 10% of light-skinned patients exhibited an erythematous rash during this phase. Two to three days later, an enanthem appears concomitantly with a discrete rash about the face, hands, and forearms. Following eruptions on the lower extremities, the rash spread centrally to the trunk over the next week. Lesions quickly progressed from macules to papules, and eventually to pustular vesicles. Lesions were more abundant on the extremities and face, and this centrifugal distribution is an important diagnostic feature. In distinct contrast to varicella, lesions on various segments of the body remain generally synchronous in their stages of development. From 8 to 14 days after onset, the pustules form scabs that leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing. Although variola concentrations in the throat, conjunctiva, and urine diminish with time, virus can be readily recovered from scabs throughout convalescence. Therefore, patients should be isolated and considered infectious until all scabs separate. For the past century, two distinct types of smallpox were recognized. Variola minor was distinguished by milder systemic toxicity and more diminutive pox lesions, and caused 1% mortality in unvaccinated victims. However, the prototypical disease variola major caused mortality of 3% and 30% in the vaccinated and unvaccinated, respectively. Other clinical forms associated with variola major, flat-type and hemorrhagic type smallpox were notable for severe mortality. A naturally occurring relative of variola, monkey pox, occurs in Africa, and is clinically indistinguishable from smallpox with the exception of a lower case fatality rate and notable enlargement of cervical and inguinal lymph nodes.|h.Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis: Incubation period 1-6 days. Acute systemic febrile illness with encephalitis developing in a small percentage (4% children; < 1% adults). Generalized malaise, spiking fevers, rigors, severe headache, photophobia, and myalgias for 24-72 hours. Nausea, vomiting, cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may follow. Full recovery from malaise and fatigue takes 1-2 weeks. The incidence of CNS disease and associated morbidity and mortality would be much higher after a BW attack. Susceptibility is high (90-100%), and nearly 100% of those infected develop overt illnesses. The overall case fatality rate for VEE is <1%, although it is somewhat higher in the very young or aged. Recovery from an infection results in excellent short-term and long-term immunity. VEE is primarily an acute, incapacitating, febrile illness with encephalitis developing in only a small percentage of the infected population. Most VEE infections are mild (EEE and WEE are predominantly encephalitis infections). After an incubation period from 1-6 days, onset is usually sudden. The acute phase lasts 24-72 hours and is manifested by generalized malaise, chills, spiking high fevers (38C-40.5C), rigors, severe headache, photophobia, and myalgias in the legs and lumbosacral area. Nausea, vomiting, cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may follow. Physical signs include conjunctival injection, erythematous pharynx and muscle tenderness. Patients would be incapacitated by malaise and fatigue for 1-2 weeks before full recovery. During natural epidemics, approximately 4% of infected children (<15 years old) and less than 1% of adults will develop signs of severe CNS infection (35% fatality for children and 10% for adults). Adults rarely develop neurologic complications during natural infections. Experimental aerosol challenges in animals suggest that the incidence of CNS disease and associated morbidity and mortality would be much higher after a BW attack, as the VEE virus would infect the olfactory nerve and spread directly to the CNS. Mild CNS findings would include lethargy, somnolence, or mild confusion, with or without nuchal rigidity. Seizures, ataxia, paralysis, or coma follow more severe CNS involvement. VEE infection during pregnancy may cause encephalitis in the fetus, placental damage, abortion, or severe congenital neuroanatomical anomalies.|i.Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF): VHFs are febrile illnesses which can feature flushing of the face and chest, petechiae, bleeding, edema, hypotension, and shock. Malaise, myalgias, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur in any of the hemorrhagic fevers. The clinical syndrome that these viruses may cause is generally referred to as viral hemorrhagic fever, or VHF. The target organ in the VHF syndrome is the vascular bed; accordingly, the dominant clinical features are usually due to microvascular damage and changes in vascular permeability. Not all infected patients develop VHF. There is both divergence and uncertainty about which host factors and viral strain characteristics might be responsible for the mechanisms of disease. For example, an immunopathogenic mechanism has been identified for dengue hemorrhagic fever, which usually occurs among patients previously infected with a heterologous dengue serotype. Antibody directed against the previous strain enhances uptake of dengue virus by circulating monocytes. These cells express viral antigens on their surfaces. Lysis of the infected monocytes by cytotoxic T-cell responses results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-coagulants, and anticoagulants, which in turn results in vascular injury and permeability, complement activation, and a systemic coagulopathy. DIC has been implicated in Rift Valley, Marburg and Ebola fevers, but in most VHFs the etiology of the coagulopathy is multifactorial (e.g., hepatic damage, consumptive coagulopathy, and primary marrow injury to megakaryocytes). Common symptoms are fever, myalgia, and prostration. Physical examination may reveal only conjunctival injection, mild hypotension, flushing, and petechial hemorrhages. Full-blown VHF typically evolves to shock and generalized mucous membrane hemorrhage, and often is accompanied by evidence of pulmonary hematopoietic, and neurologic involvement. Renal insufficiency is proportional to cardiovascular compromise, except in HFRS, which features renal failure as an integral part of the disease process. Apart from epidemiologic and intelligence information, some distinctive clinical features may suggest a specific etiologic agent. While hepatic involvement is common among the VHFs, a clinical picture dominated by jaundice and other features of hepatitis is only seen in some cases of Rift Valley fever, Congo-Crimean, Marburg, and Ebola HFs, and yellow fever. Kyanasur Forest disease and Omsk hemorrhagic fever are notable for pulmonary involvement, and a biphasic illness with subsequent CNS manifestations. Among the arenavirus infections, Lassa fever can cause severe peripheral edema due to capillary leak, but hemorrhage is uncommon, while hemorrhage is commonly caused by the South American arenaviruses. Severe hemorrhage and nosocomial transmission are typical for Congo-Crimean HF. Retinitis is commonly seen in Rift Valley fever, and hearing loss is common among Lassa fever survivors. Because of their worldwide occurrence, additional consideration should be given to Hantavirus infections. Classic HFRS has a severe course that progresses sequentially from fever through hemorrhage, shock, renal failure, and polyuria. Nephropathia endemica features prominent fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, and oliguria, without shock or severe hemorrhagic manifestations. North American cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) due to the Sin Nombre virus lack hemorrhagic manifestations and renal failure, but nevertheless carry a very high mortality due to rapidly progressive and severe pulmonary capillary leak, which presents as ARDS. These syndromes may overlap. Subclinical or clinical pulmonary edema may occur in HFRS and nephropathia endemica, while HFRS has complicated HPS due to South American Hantaviruses and the Bayou and Black Creek Canal viruses in North America. Mortality may be substantial, ranging from 0.2% percent for nephropathia endemica, to 50 to 90 percent among Ebola victims.|j.Botulinum: Usually begins with cranial nerve palsies, including ptosis, blurred vision, diplopia, dry mouth and throat, dysphagia, and dysphonia. This is followed by symmetrical descending flaccid paralysis, with generalized weakness and progression to respiratory failure. Symptoms begin as early as 12-36 hours after inhalation, but may take several days after exposure to low doses of toxin. The onset of symptoms of inhalation botulism usually occurs from 12 to 36 hours following exposure, but can vary according to the amount of toxin absorbed, and could be reduced following a BW attack. Recent primate studies indicate that the signs and symptoms may not appear for several days when a low dose of the toxin is inhaled versus a shorter time period following ingestion of toxin or inhalation of higher doses. Cranial nerve palsies are prominent early, with eye symptoms such as blurred vision due to mydriasis, diplopia, ptosis, and photophobia, in addition to other cranial nerve signs such as dysarthria, dysphonia, and dysphagia. Flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis follows, in a symmetrical, descending, and progressive manner. Collapse of the upper airway may occur due to weakness of the oropharyngeal musculature. As the descending motor weakness involves the diaphragm and accessory muscles of respiration, respiratory failure may occur abruptly. Progression from onset of symptoms to respiratory failure has occurred in as little as 24 hours in cases of severe food borne botulism. The autonomic effects of botulism are manifested by typical anticholinergic signs and symptoms: dry mouth, ileus, constipation, and urinary retention. Nausea and vomiting may occur as nonspecific sequelae of an ileus. Dilated pupils (mydriasis) are seen in approximately 50 percent of cases. Sensory symptoms usually do not occur. Botulinum toxins do not cross the blood/brain barrier and do not cause CNS disease. However, the psychological sequelae of botulism may be severe and require specific intervention. Physical examination usually reveals an afebrile, alert, and oriented patient. Postural hypotension may be present. Mucous membranes may be dry and crusted and the patient may complain of dry mouth or sore throat. There may be difficulty with speaking and swallowing. Gag reflex may be absent. Pupils may be dilated and even fixed. Ptosis and extraocular muscle palsies may also be present. Variable degrees of skeletal muscle weakness may be observed depending on the degree of progression in an individual patient. Deep tendon reflexes may be present or absent. With severe respiratory muscle paralysis, the patient may become cyanotic or exhibit narcosis from CO2 retention.|k.Ricin: Acute onset of fever, chest tightness, cough, dyspnea, nausea, and arthralgias occurs 4 to 8 hours after inhalational exposure. Airway necrosis and pulmonary capillary leak resulting in pulmonary edema would likely occur within 18-24 hours, followed by severe respiratory distress and death from hypoxemia in 36-72 hours. The clinical picture in intoxicated victims would depend on the route of exposure. After aerosol exposure, signs and symptoms would depend on the dose inhaled. Accidental sublethal aerosol exposures which occurred in humans in the 1940's were characterized by acute onset of the following symptoms in 4 to 8 hours: fever, chest tightness, cough, dyspnea, nausea, and arthralgias. The onset of profuse sweating some hours later was commonly the sign of termination of most of the symptoms. Although lethal human aerosol exposures have not been described, the severe pathophysiologic changes seen in the animal respiratory tract, including necrosis and severe alveolar flooding, are probably sufficient to cause death from ARDS and respiratory failure. Time to death in experimental animals is dose dependent, occurring 36-72 hours post inhalation exposure. Humans would be expected to develop severe lung inflammation with progressive cough, dyspnea, cyanosis and pulmonary edema. By other routes of exposure, ricin is not a direct lung irritant; however, intravascular injection can cause minimal pulmonary perivascular edema due to vascular endothelial injury. Ingestion causes necrosis of the gastrointestinal epithelium, local hemorrhage, and hepatic, splenic, and renal necrosis. Intramuscular injection causes severe local necrosis of muscle and regional lymph nodes with moderate visceral organ involvement.|l.Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B: Latent period of 3-12 hours after aerosol exposure is followed by sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, myalgia, and nonproductive cough. Some patients may develop shortness of breath and retrosternal chest pain. Patients tend to plateau rapidly to a fairly stable clinical state. Fever may last 2 to 5 days, and cough may persist for up to 4 weeks. Patients may also present with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea if they swallow the toxin. Presumably, higher exposure can lead to septic shock and death. Symptoms of SEB intoxication begin after a latent period of 3-12 hours after inhalation, or 4-10 hours after ingestion. Symptoms include nonspecific flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, headache, myalgias), and specific features dependent on the route of exposure. Oral exposure results in predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Inhalation exposures produce predominantly respiratory symptoms: nonproductive cough, retrosternal chest pain, and dyspnea. GI symptoms may accompany respiratory exposure due to inadvertent swallowing of the toxin after normal mucocilliary clearance. Respiratory pathology is due to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades in the lungs, leading to pulmonary capillary leak and pulmonary edema. Severe cases may result in acute pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. The fever may last up to five days and range from 103 to 106F, with variable degrees of chills and prostration. The cough may persist up to four weeks, and patients may not be able to return to duty for two weeks. Physical examination in patients with SEB intoxication is often unremarkable. Conjunctival injection may be present, and postural hypotension may develop due to fluid losses. Chest examination is unremarkable except in the unusual case where pulmonary edema develops. The chest X-ray is also generally normal, but in severe cases increased interstitial markings, atelectasis, and possibly overt pulmonary edema or an ARDS picture may develop.|m.T-2 Mycotoxin: Exposure causes skin pain, pruritus, redness"

The spores are the usual infective form. Anthrax is primarily a zoonotic disease of herbivores, with cattle, sheep, goats, and horses being the usual domesticated animal hosts, but other animals may be infected. Humans generally contract the disease when handling contaminated hair, wool, hides, flesh, blood and excreta of infected animals and from manufactured products such as bone meal. Infection is introduced through scratches or abrasions of the skin, wounds, inhalation of spores, eating insufficiently cooked infected meat, or by biting flies. The primary concern for intentional infection by this organism is through inhalation after aerosol dissemination of spores. All human populations are susceptible. The spores are very stable and may remain viable for many years in soil and water. They resist sunlight for varying periods.|b.Brucellosis: Brucellosis is one of the world's most important veterinary diseases, and is caused by infection with one of six species of Brucellae, a group of gram-negative cocco-baccillary facultative intracellular pathogens. In animals, brucellosis primarily involves the reproductive tract, causing septic abortion and orchitis, which, in turn, can result in sterility. Consequently, brucellosis is a disease of great potential economic impact in the animal husbandry industry. Four species (B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. suis, and, rarely, B. canis) are pathogenic in humans. Infections in abattoir and laboratory workers suggest that the Brucellae are highly infectious via the aerosol route. It is estimated that inhalation of only 10 to 100 bacteria is sufficient to cause disease in man.|c.Glanders and Melioidosis: The causative agents of Glanders and Melioidosis are Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei, respectively. Both are gram-negative bacilli with a safety-pin"" appearance on microscopic examination. Both pathogens affect domestic and wild animals, which, like humans, acquire the diseases from inhalation or contaminated injuries. B. mallei is primarily noted for producing disease in horses, mules, and donkeys. In the past man has seldom been infected, despite frequent and often close contact with infected animals. This may be the result of exposure to low concentrations of organisms from infected sites in ill animals and because strains virulent for equids are often less virulent for man. There are four basic forms of disease in horses and man. The acute forms are more common in mules and donkeys, with death typically occurring 3 to 4 weeks after illness onset. The chronic form of the disease is more common in horses and causes generalized lymphadenopathy, multiple skin nodules that ulcerate and drain, and induration, enlargement, and nodularity of regional lymphatics on the extremities and in other areas. The lymphatic thickening and induration has been called farcy. Human cases have occurred primarily in veterinarians, horse and donkey caretakers, and abattoir workers. B. pseudomallei is widely distributed in many tropical and subtropical regions. The disease is endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. In northeastern Thailand, B. pseudomallei, is one of the most common causative agents of community-acquired septicemia. Melioidosis presents in humans in several distinct forms, ranging from a subclinical illness to an overwhelming septicemia, with a 90% mortality rate and death within 24-48 hours after onset. Also, melioidosis can reactivate years after primary infection and result in chronic and life-threatening disease. These organisms spread to man by invading the nasal, oral, and conjunctival mucous membranes, by inhalation into the lungs, and by invading abraded or lacerated skin. Aerosols from cultures have been observed to be highly infectious to laboratory workers. Biosafety level 3 containment practices are required when working with these organisms in the laboratory. Since aerosol spread is efficient, and there is no available vaccine or reliable therapy, B. mallei and B. pseudomallei have both been viewed as potential BW agents.|d.Plague: Yersinia pestis is a rod-shaped, non-motile, non-sporulating, gram-negative bacterium of the family Enterobacteraceae. It causes plague, a zoonotic disease of rodents (e.g., rats, mice, ground squirrels). Fleas that live on the rodents can transmit the bacteria to humans, who then suffer from the bubonic form of plague. The bubonic form may progress to the septicemic and/or pneumonic forms. Pneumonic plague would be the predominant form after a purposeful aerosol dissemination. All human populations are susceptible. Recovery from the disease is followed by temporary immunity. The organism remains viable in water, moist soil, and grains for several weeks. At near freezing temperatures, it will remain alive from months to years but is killed by 15 minutes of exposure to 55C. It also remains viable for some time in dry sputum, flea feces, and buried bodies but is killed within several hours of exposure to sunlight.|e.Q-Fever: The endemic form of Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the rickettsia, Coxiella burnetii. Its natural reservoirs are sheep, cattle, goats, dogs, cats and birds. The organism grows to especially high concentrations in placental tissues. The infected animals do not develop the disease, but do shed large numbers of the organisms in placental tissues and body fluids including milk, urine, and feces. Exposure to infected animals at parturition is an important risk factor for endemic disease. Humans acquire the disease by inhalation of aerosols contaminated with the organisms. Farmers and abattoir workers are at greatest risk occupationally. A biological warfare attack with Q fever would cause a disease similar to that occurring naturally. Q fever is also a significant hazard in laboratory personnel who are working with the organism.|f.Tularemia: Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is a small, aerobic non-motile, gram-negative cocco-bacillus. Tularemia (also known as rabbit fever and deer fly fever) is a zoonotic disease that humans typically acquire after skin or mucous membrane contact with tissues or body fluids of infected animals, or from bites of infected ticks, deerflies, or mosquitoes. Less commonly, inhalation of contaminated dusts or ingestion of contaminated foods or water may produce clinical disease. Respiratory exposure by aerosol would typically cause typhoidal or pneumonic tularemia. F. tularensis can remain viable for weeks in water, soil, carcasses, hides, and for years in frozen rabbit meat. It is resistant for months to temperatures of freezing and below. It is easily killed by heat and disinfectants.|g.Smallpox: Smallpox is caused by the Orthopox virus, variola, which occurs in at least two strains, variola major and the milder disease, variola minor. Despite the global eradication of smallpox and continued availability of a vaccine, the potential weaponization of variola continues to pose a military threat. This threat can be attributed to the aerosol infectivity of the virus, the relative ease of large-scale production, and an increasingly Orthopoxvirus-naive populace. Although the fully developed cutaneous eruption of smallpox is unique, earlier stages of the rash could be mistaken for varicella. Secondary spread of infection constitutes a nosocomial hazard from the time of onset of a smallpox patient's exanthem until scabs have separated. Quarantine with respiratory isolation should be applied to secondary contacts for 17 days post-exposure. Vaccinia vaccination and vaccinia immune globulin each possess some efficacy in post-exposure prophylaxis.|h.Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis: The Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus complex is a group of eight mosquito-borne alphaviruses that are endemic in northern South America and Trinidad and causes rare cases of human encephalitis in Central America, Mexico, and Florida. These viruses can cause severe diseases in humans and Equidae (horses, mules, burros, and donkeys). Natural infections are acquired by the bites of a wide variety of mosquitoes. Equidae serve as amplifying hosts and source of mosquito infection. Western and Eastern Equine Encephalitis viruses are similar to the VEE complex, are often difficult to distinguish clinically, and share similar aspects of transmission and epidemiology. The human infective dose for VEE is considered to be 10-100 organisms, which is one of the principal reasons that VEE is considered a militarily effective BW agent. Neither the population density of infected mosquitoes nor the aerosol concentration of virus particles has to be great to allow significant transmission of VEE in a BW attack. There is no evidence of direct human-to-human or horse-to-human transmission. Natural aerosol transmission is not known to occur. VEE particles are not considered stable in the environment, and are thus not as persistent as the bacteria responsible for Q fever, tularemia or anthrax. Heat and standard disinfectants can easily kill the VEE virus complex.|i.Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF): The viral hemorrhagic fevers are a diverse group of illnesses caused by RNA viruses from four viral families. The Arenaviridae include the etiologic agents of Argentine, Bolivian, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers, and Lassa fever. The Bunyaviridae include the members of the Hantavirus genus, the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever virus from the Nairovirus genus, and the Rift Valley fever virus from the Phlebovirus genus; the Filoviridae include Ebola and Marburg viruses; and the Flaviviridae include dengue and yellow fever viruses. These viruses are spread in a variety of ways; some may be transmitted to humans through a respiratory portal of entry. Although evidence for weaponization does not exist for many of these viruses, they are included in this handbook because of their potential for aerosol dissemination or weaponization, or likelihood for confusion with similar agents that might be weaponized.|j.Botulinum: The botulinum toxins are a group of seven related neurotoxins produced by the spore-forming bacillus Clostridium botulinum and two other Clostridia species. These toxins, types A through G, are the most potent neurotoxins known; paradoxically, they have been used therapeutically to treat spastic conditions (strabismus, blepharospasm, torticollis, tetanus) and cosmetically to treat wrinkles. The spores are ubiquitous; they germinate into vegetative bacteria that produce toxins during anaerobic incubation. Industrial-scale fermentation can produce large quantities of toxin for use as a BW agent. There are three epidemiologic forms of naturally occurring botulism: food borne, infantile, and wound. Botulinum could be delivered by aerosol or used to contaminate food or water supplies. When inhaled, these toxins produce a clinical picture very similar to food borne intoxication, although the time to onset of paralytic symptoms after inhalation may actually be longer than for food borne cases, and may vary by type and dose of toxin. The clinical syndrome produced by these toxins is known as botulism.""|k.Ricin: Ricin is a potent protein cytotoxin derived from the beans of the castor plant (Ricinus communis). Castor beans are ubiquitous worldwide, and the toxin is fairly easy to extract; ricin is potentially widely available. When inhaled as a small particle aerosol, this toxin may produce pathologic changes within 8 hours and severe respiratory symptoms followed by acute hypoxic respiratory failure in 36-72 hours. When ingested, ricin causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms followed by vascular collapse and death. This toxin may also cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, microcirculatory failure and multiple organ failure if given intravenously in laboratory animals.|l.Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B: Staphylococcus aureus produces a number of exotoxins, one of which is Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, or SEB. Such toxins are referred to as exotoxins since they are excreted from the organism, and because they normally exert their effects on the intestines they are called enterotoxins. SEB is one of the pyrogenic toxins that commonly causes food poisoning in humans after the toxin is produced in improperly handled foodstuffs and subsequently ingested. SEB has a very broad spectrum of biological activity. This toxin causes a markedly different clinical syndrome when inhaled than it characteristically produces when ingested. Significant morbidity is produced in individuals who are exposed to SEB by either portal of entry to the body.|m.T-2 Mycotoxins: The trichothecene (T-2) mycotoxins are a group of over 40 compounds produced by fungi of the genus Fusarium, a common grain mold. They are small molecular weight compounds, and are extremely stable in the environment. They are the only class of toxin that is dermally active, causing blisters within a relatively short time after exposure (minutes to hours). Dermal, ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal exposures would be expected after an attack with mycotoxins."

An FDA-licensed vaccine is available. Vaccine schedule is 0.5 ml SC at 0, 2, 4 weeks, then 6, 12, and 18 months (primary series), followed by annual boosters.|b.Brucellosis: There is no human vaccine available against brucellosis, although animal vaccines exist. Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended after possible exposure to endemic disease. Treatment should be considered for high-risk exposure to the veterinary vaccine, inadvertent laboratory exposure, or confirmed biological warfare exposure.|c.Glanders and Melioidosis: Currently, no pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis is available.|d.Plague: For asymptomatic persons exposed to a plague aerosol or to a patient with suspected pneumonic plague, appropriate course of antibiotic therapy or the duration of risk of exposure plus one week. No vaccine is currently available for plague prophylaxis. The previously available licensed, killed vaccine was effective against bubonic plague, but not against aerosol exposure.|e.Q-Fever: Chemoprophylaxis begun too early during the incubation period may delay but not prevent the onset of symptoms. Therefore, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be started 8-12 days post exposure and continued for 5 days. Antibiotic therapy has been shown to prevent clinical disease. An inactivated whole cell IND vaccine is effective in eliciting protection against exposure, but severe local reactions to this vaccine may be seen in those who already possess immunity. Therefore, an intradermal skin test is recommended to detect pre-sensitized or immune individuals.|f.Tularemia: A live, attenuated vaccine is available as an investigational new drug. It is administered once by scarification. A two-week course of tetracycline is effective as prophylaxis when given after exposure.|g.Smallpox: Immediate vaccination or revaccination should be undertaken for all personnel exposed.|h.Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis: A live, attenuated vaccine is available as an investigational new drug. A second, formalin-inactivated, killed vaccine is available for boosting antibody titers in those initially receiving the first vaccine. No post-exposure immunoprophylaxis. In experimental animals, alpha-interferon and the interferon-inducer poly-ICLC have proven highly effective as post-exposure prophylaxis. There are no human clinical data.|i.Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers: The only licensed VHF vaccine is yellow fever vaccine. Prophylactic ribavirin may be effective for Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, CCHF, and possibly HFRS (available only as IND under protocol).|j.Botulinum Toxin: Pentavalent toxoid vaccine (types A, B, C, D, and E) is available as an IND product for those at high risk of exposure.|k.Ricin: There is currently no vaccine or prophylactic antitoxin available for human use, although immunization appears promising in animal models. Use of the protective mask is currently the best protection against inhalation.|l.Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B: Use of protective mask.

More prolonged regimens may be required for patients with complications of meningoencephalitis, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis.|c.Glanders and Melioidosis: Therapy will vary with the type and severity of the clinical presentation. Patients with localized disease, may be managed with oral antibiotics for a duration of 60-150 days. More severe illness may require parenteral therapy and more prolonged treatment.|d.Plague: Early administration of antibiotics is critical, as pneumonic plague is invariably fatal if antibiotic therapy is delayed more than one day after the onset of symptoms.|e.Q-Fever: Q fever is generally a self-limited illness even without treatment, but antibiotic therapy should be provided to prevent complications of the disease. Q fever endocarditis (rare) is much more difficult to treat.|f.Tularemia: Administration of antibiotics with early treatment is very effective.|g.Smallpox: At present there is no effective chemotherapy, and treatment of a clinical case remains supportive.|h.Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis: Treatment is supportive only.

Exposure to low or medium doses can produce runny/watery eyes, pinpoint pupils, eye pain, blurred vision, drooling, excessive sweating, cough, chest tightness, rapid breathing, diarrhea, increased urination, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, change in heart rate, change in blood pressure. Exposure to a large dose of nerve agents can cause loss of consciousness, convulsions, paralysis, or respiratory failure with the possibility of leading to death. Mild or moderately exposed individuals usually recover completely, but severely exposed individuals are not likely to survive.|i.Tabun: symptoms can occur within a few seconds if exposed to the vapor form, and a few minutes to up to 18 hours after being exposed to the liquid form.|ii.Sarin: is one of the most volatile nerve agents, and can easily transform from a liquid in to a vapor and spread in to the environment. Even a small drop of Sarin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where it touches the skin.|iii.Soman: exposure can occur through skin contact, eye contact, or inhalation. It mixes easily with water and can be used to poison water, or it can also be used to poison with. Victim's clothes can release Soman for up to 30 minutes following exposure, rendering them toxic and likely to infect others. Repeated exposure can lead to accumulation of the chemical in the body due to its slow elimination. Soman vapor is thicker than air, and thus usually settles closer to the ground.|iv.VX: Symptoms can be expected from 4 to 14 hours following exposure to VX. Of all the nerve agents, VX is the most volatile and can be easily transformed into gas. It is also the most toxic and more likely to produce the lethal side effects following exposure.|b.BLISTER/VESICANT AGENTS|The most likely routes of exposure to blister/vesicant agents are inhalation, dermal contact, and ocular contact. The severity of symptoms will be dependant upon the amount and route of exposure, as well as the pre-morbid condition of the victim.|i.Lewisite: Exposure can occur by skin or eye contact, or breathing in contaminated air. Pain and irritation can occur within seconds, redness within 15 to 30 minutes, followed by blister formation up to several hours later. The blister will eventually become large enough to cover the initial red area. The lesions produced by exposure to Lewisite heal faster, and leave less discoloration. The eyes may become irritated, painful, and swollen with the likelihood of tearing. Patients may also experience runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough. Nausea, Vomiting, and diarrhea could be expected, as well as low blood pressure (Lewisite shock"").|ii.Sulfur Mustard: sulfur mustard can be carried through the wind over great distances, and can also contaminate water. Exposure to sulfur mustard is usually not fatal. Depending upon the severity of the exposure. The victim may not experience symptoms for up to 2 to 24 hours. Sulfur can cause redness and itching of the skin within 2 to 48 hours of exposure, which may eventually lead to yellow blistering of the skin. The eyes may become irritated, painful, swollen and tearful within the first 3 to 12 hours of a mild to moderate exposure. A severe exposure could result in symptoms occurring within 1 to 2 hours of exposure, and could include light sensitivity, severe pain, or blindness that could be present for up to 10 days following the initiation of symptoms. Runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough within 12 to 24 hours of a mild exposure and within 2 to 4 hours of severe exposure can occur. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and vomiting may be present. Exposure to the liquid form is more likely to result in second and third degree burns and scarring than is exposure to the vapor form of Sulfur mustard. Excessive inhalation of the vapor can lead to long-term respiratory disorders, repeated respiratory infections, or even death. Lengthy exposure to the eye can cause permanent blindness. Exposure to Sulfur mustard places an individual at higher risk for respiratory and lung cancer.|iii.Nitrogen Mustards: These can be found in a variety of forms; oily liquids, vapor, or solid, and with a variety of different smells. The symptoms of Nitrogen exposure usually do not occur immediately, and can take up to several hours to manifest themselves. Skin can become reddened within a few hours, and could be followed by blistering within 6 to 12 hours. The eyes may become irritated, painful, swollen, and tearful, with high amounts of exposure causing blindness. Nose and sinus pain, coughing, sore throat, and shortness of breath may occur within hours. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Under extreme circumstances, individuals could experience tremors, in coordination, and seizures. The liquid form is more likely to produce second or third degree burns that are more likely to leave scarring later. Excess inhalation of the vapors can cause long-term respiratory disorders, and excess exposure to the eyes can cause chronic eye problems. Exposure has been associated with bone marrow suppression beginning as early as 3 to 5 days following the exposure, which can lead to anemia, bleeding, and increased risk for infection. Prolonged exposure to nitrogen mustards has been linked top leukemia.|iv.Phosgene Oxime: This can cause instant, excruciating pain of the skin almost immediately upon exposure to the chemical. Within seconds, blanching of the skin surrounded by red rings can occur, and within 15 minutes, the skin develops hives. 24 hours later, the whitened areas of the skin become brown and die, leaving a scab. As the skin heals, the patient may continue to experience itching and pain. Immediately following inhalation, victims should expect runny nose, hoarseness, and sinus pain. Absorbing Phosgene through the skin, or inhaling it can cause pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) with symptoms of shortness of breath and cough.|c.BLOOD AGENTS|i.Cyanide: Toxicity from this agent can be achieved through inhalation, contact with poisoned soil, drinking contaminated water, or eating contaminated food. The extent of the poisoning depends upon the route and length of exposure. The most harmful method of toxicity is through inhalation. As the gaseous form evaporates rather quickly, Cyanide is less toxic in large outdoor areas being that it is less dense than air and rises fast. This agent prevents the adequate delivery of oxygen to cells, and can be detrimental to the heart and brain. Upon exposure, the following symptoms can be seen within minutes; rapid breathing, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, rapid heart rate, headache, nausea, and vomiting. As poisoning progresses, respirations become slow and gasping and the skin may appear slightly blue in color. The lungs may become filled with fluid. Central nervous system symptoms usually occur rapidly, and include excitement, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, and weakness. As poisoning progresses, drowsiness, spasms, lockjaw, convulsions, hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and coma may occur. Exposure to larger amounts may cause convulsions, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, loss of consciousness, respiratory failure leading to death. Survivors of serious Cyanide poisoning may develop heart and brain damage. Personality changes, memory deficits, disturbances in voluntary muscle movements, and the appearance in involuntary muscle movements have also been reported in survivors of Cyanide poisoning. Chronically exposed workers may complain of headache, eye irritation, easy fatigue, chest discomfort, palpitations, loss of appetite, and nosebleeds.|d.PULMONARY AGENTS|i.Chlorine: This can be found in industry and in households in the form of bleach, pesticides, rubber, and solvents. The gaseous form can be recognized by its pungent, irritating odor, and it's yellow-green color. Chlorine can manifest its poison effects through skin/eye contact, inhalation, and ingestion of contaminated food or water. The seriousness of the side effects depend on the amount and type of Chlorine exposure. During, or immediately after inhalation of low concentrations victims may experience eye and nasal irritation, sore throat, and coughing. Higher concentration can rapidly lead to respiratory distress with airway constriction, and accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Chlorine can initially increase heart rate and blood pressure, and eventually lead to Cardiovascular collapse due to lack of oxygen. Low exposure the skin can cause burning pain, inflammation, and blisters, while it can cause involuntary blinking, redness, and tearing in the eyes. Following an isolated exposure, lung function can return to near normal in 7-14 days. Though complete recovery usually occurs, a chemical irritant-induced type of asthma known as Reactive airway syndrome (RAS) has occurred in some victims.|ii.Phosgene: The extent of the poising depends on how close the victims are to the place where the gas is released, the type, and amount of exposure. Routes of contamination include inhalation, skin/eye contact, and eating/drinking contaminated food or water. According to OSHA, the odor provides insufficient warning of hazardous concentrations. Inhaling low concentrations of Phosgene may initially cause minimal symptoms such as dryness/burning of the throat and cough, which may discontinue once the patient is removed from the source of exposure. However, after a 30 minute up to a 48 hour symptom free interval, some victims may experience rapid worsening of lung function which may include fluid accumulation in the lungs, rapid respiration, or painful cough which may produce frothy white or yellow liquid. Phosgene has also been linked to RAS. Due to any possible accumulation in the lungs, the inadequate supply of oxygen to the body can manifest as damage to the heart and it's important capillaries. If, upon exposure, the victim's skin is wet or moist, it can become irritated and red almost immediately. Liquid Phosgene can result in frostbite. Phosgene vapor can cause redness and tearing of the eye, clouding in the cornea, and perforation. Nausea and vomiting may be experienced. At high levels of exposure, permanent damage to the kidneys and liver can occur. If the victim survives the first 48 hours of exposure, they are likely to survive, but may acquire long term sensitivity to chemical irritants, chronic inflammation and irritation of the bronchioles (lung tubes), emphysema, and increased susceptibility to infections. Workers exposed to daily high levels of the chemical have been shown to have an increased risk of diseases and death associated with long term lung disorders."

It may contain 5-20 percent chlorobenzene as solvent and stabilizer. The substance can be absorbed into the body by all routes. Usually liquid in normal state, but will volatilize if heated to form vapor or aerosol. As little as 1 to 10 mls can be lethal.|b.Sarin: is also a clear, colorless, tasteless liquid, but has no identifiable odor. Sarin is one of the more volatile nerve agents and can easily be transformed in to a gaseous state, rendering it more able to spread through the environment. A persons clothing can release Sarin up to 30 minutes after exposure.|c.Soman: is a clear, colorless liquid that has been associated with a camphor or rotting fruit odor. It vaporizes in to air easily.|d.VX: VX is a tasteless oily liquid that is amber in color, and evaporates at a slow rate comparable to the rate at which motor oil would evaporate. Extremely high temperatures are required to make VX evaporate.|e.Lewisite: an oily colorless liquid in its pure form that may appear amber to black in its impure form. It has an odor similar to geraniums. Lewisite contains arsenic, and thus has some effects similar to arsenic poisoning, including stomach ailments and low blood pressure.|f.Sulfur Mustard: This can be clear or a yellow-brown colored in its oily liquid or solid state. It can also vaporize and spread through the environment. SM sometimes smells like garlic, mustard, onions, or nothing at all. It can last in the environment for up to 2 days following release in regular weather conditions, but under very cold conditions, it can last for up to weeks or months.|g.Nitrogen mustards: These can be oily liquid, vapor, or solid forms. NM's can smell fishy, musty, soapy, or fruity. They can be clear, pale amber, or yellow in appearance.|h.Phosgene Oxime: This is also known as an urticant or nettle agent due to its ability to produce intense itching and rash, similar to hives, when it comes in contact with skin. In the liquid state, it appears to be yellow in color, while in the solid state it is clear. It is known to possess a disagreeable, irritating odor. It does not last in the environment for long as it breaks down within 2 hours in soil, and within a few days within water.|i.Cyanide: It is a colorless or pale blue liquid at room temperature. Being very volatile, it can readily produce toxic, flammable concentrations at room temperature. It has a distinct bitter almond odor and the ability to perceive it is a genetic trait (20 to 40% of the general population cannot detect Hydrogen Cyanide).|j.Chlorine: This is one of the most commonly manufactured chemicals in the US for uses both industrial and household. It can present as a poisonous gaseous form, which can also be cooled, and pressurized in order to store or transport it. Once this liquid is released, it quickly turns in to the gaseous form that spreads relatively fast, and close to the ground. Chlorine gas has a distinct pungent, irritating odor, much like bleach and usually appears to be yellow-green in color at room temperature. At higher pressures, or temperatures below -30F, it is a clear, amber-colored liquid. Though Chlorine gas itself is noncombustible, it is a strong oxidizer that can readily form explosive compounds when it comes in to contact with many common substances. Chlorine gas is highly corrosive when it comes in to contact with any dermal surfaces, e.g., skin, eyes. Pure Chlorine is unlikely to be ingested, for it is a gas at room temperature.|k.Phosgene: This is a major industrial chemical used to make plastics and pesticides. At normal room temperature, Phosgene is a poisonous gas. It can be cooled, or pressurized in to a liquid form so that it may be packaged and transported; once opened, it will quickly return to its gaseous state, and spread fast in to the environment close to the ground. The gaseous form may be colorless or pale yellow in color. At low concentrations the gas may smell pleasantly of newly mown hay, but at higher concentrations, it may become a stronger, more unpleasant smell. Phosgene is non-flammable, unless mixed with certain other chemicals.^20110501"

^AUMDATA(1748,0)="1748^EDT^PREVENTION^P^ENC^The patient/family will understand ways to reduce risk of developing encephalitis.^1.Discuss prevention of encephalitis. Encephalitis cannot be prevented except to try to prevent the illnesses that may lead to it. The best way to prevent infectious encephalitis is to take precautions to avoid exposure to viruses or bacteria that can cause the disease:|a.Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the restroom and before and after meals.|b.Don't share tableware and beverages.|c.Teach children to practice good hygiene and to avoid sharing utensils at home and school.|d.Keep children's vaccinations current. Before traveling, ask healthcare provider about recommended vaccinations for different destinations.|2.Explain how to minimize exposure to mosquitoes and ticks by following these tips:|a.Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active and when in a wooded area with tall grasses and shrubs where ticks are more common.|b.Apply mosquito repellent. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends two productsDEET and picaridinto repel mosquitoes. Products with higher concentrations of the active ingredient provide longer protection. The EPA also recommends oil of lemon eucalyptus but cautions that its effect is comparable to low concentrations of DEET and provides protection for about an hour. Mosquito repellents can be applied to both the skin and clothes. To apply repellent to the face, spray it on the hands and then wipe it on the face. If using both sunscreen and a repellent, apply sunscreen first. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents not to use insect repellents on infants younger than 2 months of age. Instead, cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. Tips for using mosquito repellent with children include the following:|i.Always assist children with the use of mosquito repellent.|ii.Spray on clothing and exposed skin.|iii.Apply the repellent when outdoors to lessen the risk of inhaling the repellent.|iv.Spray repellent on the hands and then apply it to the child's face. Take care around the eyes and ears.|v.Dont use repellent on the hands of young children who may put their hands in their mouths.|c.Avoid mosquitoes. Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most prevalent. If possible, avoid being outdoors from dusk till dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.|d.Keep mosquitoes out of the home. Repair holes in screens on doors and windows.|e.Get rid of water sources outside the home. Where possible, eliminate standing water in the yard, where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. Common problems include flowerpots or other gardening containers, flat roofs, old tires and clogged gutters.|f.Control mosquitoes in standing water. Fill ornamental pools with mosquito-eating fish. Use mosquito dunks products that are toxic to mosquito larvae in birdbaths, ponds and garden water barrels.|g.Look for outdoor signs of viral disease. If you notice sick or dying birds or animals, report your observations to the local health department or public health agency."

^AUMDATA(2805,0)="2805^EDT^DISEASE PROCESS^DP^MNG^The patient/family will understand meningitis.^1.Discuss the disease process of meningitis. Meningitis usually results from a viral infection, but the cause may also be a bacterial infection. Less commonly, a fungal infection may cause meningitis. Because bacterial infections are the most serious and can be life-threatening, identifying the source of the infection is an important part of developing a treatment plan.|a.Acute bacterial meningitis usually occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream and migrate to the brain and spinal cord. But it can also occur when bacteria directly invade the meninges, as a result of an ear or sinus infection or a skull fracture. A number of strains of bacteria can cause acute bacterial meningitis.|b.Viral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on its own within two weeks. Each year, viruses cause a greater number of cases of meningitis than do bacteria. A group of viruses known as enteroviruses are responsible for most viral meningitis cases in the United States. Many viral meningitis episodes never have a specific virus identified as the cause. The most common signs and symptoms of enteroviral infections are rash, sore throat, diarrhea, joint aches and headache. These viruses tend to circulate in late summer and early fall. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, La Crosse virus, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis.|c.Chronic forms of meningitis occur when slow-growing organisms invade the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain. Although acute meningitis strikes suddenly, chronic meningitis develops over two weeks or more. Nevertheless, the signs and symptoms of chronic meningitis- headaches, fever, vomiting and mental cloudiness- are similar to those of acute meningitis. This type of meningitis is rare.|d.Fungal meningitis is relatively uncommon and causes chronic meningitis. Occasionally it can mimic acute bacterial meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease that affects people with immune deficiencies, such as AIDS. It's life-threatening if not treated with an antifungal medication.|e.Meningitis can also result from noninfectious causes, such as drug allergies, some types of cancer and inflammatory diseases such as lupus.|2.Explain the disease process of meningitis.|a.The hallmark signs of meningitis are sudden fever, severe headache, and a stiff neck. In more severe cases, neurological symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, confusion and disorientation, drowsiness, sensitivity to bright light, and poor appetite.|b.Meningitis often appears with flu-like symptoms that develop over 1-2 days. Distinctive rashes are typically seen in some forms of the disease. Meningococcal meningitis may be associated with kidney and adrenal gland failure and shock."

^AUMDATA(2819,0)="2819^EDT^PREVENTION^P^MNG^The patient/family will understand ways to reduce risk of developing meningitis.^1.Discuss prevention of meningitis. Meningitis typically results from contagious infections. Common bacteria or viruses that can cause meningitis can spread through coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing eating utensils, a toothbrush or a cigarette. The patient is also at increased risk if living or working with someone who has the disease. These steps can help prevent meningitis:|a.Careful hand washing is important to avoiding exposure to infectious agents. Teach children to wash their hands often, especially before they eat and after using the toilet, spending time in a crowded public place or petting animals. Show them how to wash their hands vigorously, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing thoroughly under running water.|b.Maintain the patients immune system by getting enough rest, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet with plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains.|c.When the patient needs to cough or sneeze, be sure to cover the mouth and nose. Reduce the risk of meningitis caused by listeriosis if the patient is pregnant by cooking meat thoroughly and avoiding cheeses made from unpasteurized milk.|2.Some forms of bacterial meningitis are preventable with the following vaccinations:|a.Haemophilius influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. Children in the United States routinely receive this vaccine as part of the recommended schedule of vaccines, starting at about 2 months of age. The vaccine is also recommended for some adults, including those who have sickle cell disease or AIDS and those who dont have a spleen.|b.Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). This vaccine is also part of the regular immunization schedule for children younger than 2 years in the United States. In addition, it's recommended for children between the ages of 2 and 5 who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease, including children who have chronic heart or lung disease or cancer.|c.Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). Older children and adults who need protection from pneumococcal bacteria may receive this vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the PPSV vaccine for all adults older than 65, for younger adults and children who have weak immune systems or chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes or sickle cell anemia, and for those who dont have a spleen.|d.Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that a single dose of MCV4 be given to children ages 11 to 12 or to any children ages 11 to 18 who havent yet been vaccinated. However, this vaccine can be given to younger children who are at high risk of bacterial meningitis or who have been exposed to someone with the disease. It is approved for use in children as young as 9 months old. It is also used to vaccinate healthy people who have been exposed in outbreaks but have not been previously vaccinated."

Envenomation is the process by which venom is injected by the snake bite into the human body by a venomous/poisonous snake.|a.Discuss the changes to anatomy and physiology as a result of snake bite. The outcome of snake bite depends on numerous factors, including: the species of the snake, the area of the body bitten, the amount of venom injuected, and the health conditions of the victim. Feelings of terror and panic are common after a snake bite and can produce a characteristic set of symptoms mediated by the autonomic nervous system, such as a racing heart and nausea.|b.Bites from non-venomous snakes can also cause injury, often due to lacerations caused by the snake's teeth, or from a resulting infection.|c.A bite may also trigger an anaphylactic reaction, which is potentially fatal. First aid recommendations for bites depend on the snakes inhabiting the region, because effective treatments for bites inflicted by some species can be ineffective for others.|3.Discuss the impact of these changes on the patient's health or well-being. Venom in many snakes affects virtually every organ system in the human body and can be a combination of many toxins resulting in many body parts being affected by the snake bite.|a.Local bleeding and coagulopathies are common with severe envenomation.|b.Local edema increases capillary leak and interstitial fluid in the lungs. Pulmonary mechanics may be altered significantly.|c.Local cell death increases lactic acid concentration secondary to changes in volume status and requires increased minute ventilation.|d.Neuromuscular blockade can result in poor diaphragmatic excursion. Cardia failure can result from hyptension and acidosis. Myonecrosis raises concerns about myoglobinuria and renal damage.|e.Most snake bites, whether venomous or not, will have some type of local effect. Both venomous and non-venomous snake bites may produce only minor pain and redness, or be extremely painful, tender, swollen, or necrosed.|f.Snakes are capable of biting without injecting venom into their victims. While not as life-threatening as a bite from a venomous species, the bite can be at least temporarily debilitating and could lead to dangerous infections if improperly dealt with."
^AUMDATA(4012,0)="4012^EDT^COMPLICATIONS^C^SNAKE^The patient/family will understand common or serious complications of snake bites.^1.Explain that most snakes are non-venomous. Even if a snake is venomous, many bites do not result in envenomation. The most significant risk from non-venomous bites is infection.|2.Explain that the risk from envenomation depends upon the type of the venom (type of snake) and the amount of venom injected. Venom which contains a neurotoxin is generally more dangerous than hemotoxic venom. Mohave rattlesnakes, canebrake rattlesnakes, and coral snakes have venom with a large neurotoxic component.|3.Explain that complications of envenomation may include pain, swelling and bleeding, ecchymosis (purple discoloration), necrosis (tissue dies and turns black), low blood pressure, and tingling of lips and tongue.|4.Explain that even though death from snakebite is unusual, it is still a significant risk and should prompt evaluation by a medical professional.|5.Explain that even if the victim is properly treated, damage to muscles or nerves may result in permanent disabilities or disfigurement.|6.Discuss that some persons may develop phobias or post traumatic stress disorder.
