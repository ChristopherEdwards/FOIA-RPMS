 ;;1350USEKILL^This code is used when a sealant is applied to surface(s) of any
 ;;1350USE^primary or permanent tooth.
 ;;1350USE^One unit may be reported per tooth.
 ;;0114USEKILL^When target groups (e.g. school children) are screened as
 ;;0114USE^groups to plan program activity, the code 0114 ORAL SCREENING
 ;;0114USE^may be reported using one unit per individual screened.  Oral
 ;;0114USE^screening exams may be general in nature or directed at
 ;;0114USE^specific health problems.  Screening is usually done outside
 ;;0114USE^the clinic setting and it does not include filling out an
 ;;0114USE^oral exam form (HSA 42-1).  The 0150 or 0160 should be used
 ;;0114USE^when such examination records are used.
 ;;0140USEKILL^Examination of the tissues of a portion of the oral cavity
 ;;0140USE^which involves a patient's chief complaint.  A medical
 ;;0140USE^history and limited charting to support a plan for treatment
 ;;0140USE^to relieve the complaint or symptoms are necessary to
 ;;0140USE^document this procedure (Includes no plan for routine needs).
 ;;0140USE^This code may be reported as often as necessary for a patient
 ;;0140USE^who needs emergency care.
 ;;0140USE^  
 ;;0140USE^The 0140 code can provide a general estimate of emergency
 ;;0140USE^visits in a practice.  However, if local program managers
 ;;0140USE^desire more precise tracking of emergency visits, it is
 ;;0140USE^recommended the 9170 code (emergency encounter) be reported
 ;;0140USE^in addition to the type of examination code used for the
 ;;0140USE^visit.
 ;;0150USEKILL^This code includes visual and tactile scrutiny of the tissues
 ;;0150USE^of and surrounding the oral cavity, including a medical and
 ;;0150USE^dental history, charting and the formulation of a plan of
 ;;0150USE^treatment on the patient's record.  An Initial Oral
 ;;0150USE^Examination will be provided to the patient for whom routine
 ;;0150USE^care has not been previously planned in this practice.
 ;;IH70USEKILL^  Code IH70 is used for patients who are assessed according to the
 ;;IH70USE^ IH7 Objectives but for whom NONE OF THE OTHER IH7 CODES APPLY.  
 ;;IH70USE^ 
 ;;IH70USE^ Use code IH70 when assessing patients at the first visit of the
 ;;IH70USE^ year and when the patient does not meet the criteria for any other
 ;;IH70USE IH7 monitoring code.  
 ;;IH71USEKILL^  Reported for each caries free dental patient 5-19 years during the
 ;;IH71USE^First Visit (0000) of each fiscal year.  Caries free means the
 ;;IH71USE^patient has no decayed, missing (due to caries) or filled teeth.  
 ;;IH71USE^Use special code IH71 if 
 ;;IH71USE^ - the 5-9 year old patient is caries free in the primary or mixed 
 ;;IH71USE^   dentition, including permanent teeth, or 
 ;;IH71USE^ - the 10-19 year old patient is caries free in the permanent 
 ;;IH71USE^   dentition only 
 ;;IH72USEKILL^  Reported for each dental patient age 5-19 who is found to have one
 ;;IH72USE^or more teeth which need treatment (filling or extraction) due to
 ;;IH72USE^decay at the First Visit (0000) of the fiscal year.  Use special
 ;;IH72USE^code IH72 if: 
 ;;IH72USE^ - the 5-19 year old patient needs treatment of the primary 
 ;;IH72USE^   molars or any permanent teeth.  
 ;;IH72USE^ - the 10-19 year old patient, if treatment is needed in 
 ;;IH72USE^   any permanent teeth.  
 ;;IH73USEKILL^  Reported for each patient age 5-19 who has received an occlusal 
 ;;IH73USE^sealant on at least one permanent molar.  Use special code IH73 at 
 ;;IH73USE^the First Visit (0000) or at a subsequent visit, but only once per
 ;;IH73USE^fiscal year per patient.  For example, if the first sealant is 
 ;;IH73USE^placed on a molar during a revisit (0190), the IH73 code should be
 ;;IH73USE^reported for that visit.  
 ;;IH74USEKILL^  Reported for patients 14 to 45 years of age during the first 
 ;;IH74USE^routine exam (0150 or 0120) of each fiscal year, based upon Use
 ;;IH74USE^special code IH74 if the patient is found to have at least three
 ;;IH74USE^sextants with a CPITN score of 0 and no other sextants have a
 ;;IH74USE^score greater than 2.  In other words, at least half the mouth is
 ;;IH74USE^health and no pathological pockets exist.  
 ;;IH75USEKILL^  Use special code IH75 on patients age 15 to 45 years during the 
 ;;IH75USE^first routine dental exam (0150 or 0120) of each fiscal year if
 ;;IH75USE^the patient has deep (6mm or greater) pockets present as indicated 
 ;;IH75USE^by a CPITN score of 4 in at least one sextant.  This includes 
 ;;IH75USE^findings on teeth which may need extraction due to periodontitis.  
 ;;IH76USEKILL^  Use special code IH76 at the First Visit (0000) or at a subsequent
 ;;IH76USE^visit, but only once per fiscal year if the patient is found to
 ;;IH76USE^have one or more teeth missing due to tooth decay or periodontal
 ;;IH76USE^disease.  Use this code at the First Visit if a tooth is already
 ;;IH76USE^missing or at a subsequent revisit (0190) if tooth loss first 
 ;;IH76USE^occurs at that appointment.  
 ;;IH77USEKILL^  Reported only once for each dental patient age 15 years and over 
 ;;IH77USE^who becomes edentulous at this clinic.  Use special code IH77 for
 ;;IH77USE^the visit when the patient has the last of their remaining teeth
 ;;IH77USE^extracted.  This code monitors the incidence rate of new
 ;;IH77USE^edentulous patients and not patients who are already edentulous.
