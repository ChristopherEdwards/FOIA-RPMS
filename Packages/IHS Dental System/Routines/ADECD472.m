 ;;CODE^2710^CROWN - RESIN (INDIRECT)
 ;;SVC^9^45^521.0
 ;;USE
 ;;Refers to any resin-based composite crown that is indirectly fabricated.
 ;;All fiber, porcelain or ceramic reinforced polymer materials/systems are
 ;;considered resin-based composites.  Unfilled or non-reinforced resin crowns should be reported using D2999. 
 ;;CODE^3221^PULPAL DEBRIDEMENT, PRIMARY AND PERMANENT TEETH
 ;;SVC^1^22^522.9
 ;;USE
 ;;Pulpal debridement for the relief of acute pain prior to conventional root canal therapy.
 ;;This procedure is not to be used when endodontic treatment is completed on the same day.
 ;;CODE^4273^SUBEPITHELIAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE GRAFT PROCEDURES
 ;;SVC^5^60^523.9
 ;;USE
 ;;This procedure is performed to create or augment gingiva, to obtain root coverage
 ;;to eliminate sensitivity and to prevent root caries, to eliminate frenum pull,
 ;;to extend the vestibular fornix, to augment collapsed ridges, to provide an adequate
 ;;gingival interface with a restoration or to cover bone or ridge regeneration sites when
 ;;adequate gingival tissues are not available for effective closure.  There are two surgical sites.
 ;;The recipient site utilizes a split thickness incision, retaining the overlying flap of gingiva and/or mucosa.
 ;;The connective tissue is dissected from the donor site leaving an epithelialized flap for closure.
 ;;After the graft is placed on the recipient site, it is covered with the retained overlying flap. 
 ;;CODE^4355^FULL MOUTH DEBRIDEMENT TO ENABLE COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS
 ;;SVC^3^60^523.9
 ;;USE
 ;;The removal of subgingival and/or supragingival plaque and calculus.  This procedure does not
 ;;preclude the need for additional procedures.  
 ;;CODE^4910^PERIODONTAL MAINTENANCE 
 ;;SVC^2^60^523.9
 ;;USE
 ;;This procedure is for patients who have previously been treated for periodontal disease.
 ;;Typically, maintenance starts after completion of active (surgical or nonsurgical) periodontal
 ;;therapy and continues at varying intervals, determined by the clinical diagnosis of the dentist,
 ;;for the life of the dentition.  It includes removal of the supra and subgingival microbial flora
 ;;and calculus, site specific scaling and root planing where indicated, and/or polishing the teeth.
 ;;When new or recurring periodontal disease appears, additional diagnostic and treatment procedures
 ;;must be considered.
 ;;CODE^7280^SURGICAL ACCESS OF AN UNERUPTED TOOTH
 ;;SVC^6^30^520.6
 ;;USE
 ;;An incision is made and the tissue is reflected and bone removed as necessary to expose the crown.
 ;;This procedure may include but is not limited to situations whereby an attachment is placed to
 ;;facilitate eruption. 
 ;;CODE^9220^DEEP SEDATION/GENERAL ANESTHESIA - FIRST 30 MINUTES
 ;;SVC^6^30^525.9
 ;;NOP^n
 ;;USE
 ;;Anesthesia time begins when the doctor administering the anesthetic agent initiates the
 ;;appropriate anesthesia and non-invasive monitoring protocol and remains in continuous
 ;;attendance of the patient.  Anesthesia services are considered completed when the patient
 ;;may be safely left under the observation of trained personnel and the doctor may safely
 ;;leave the room to attend to other patients or duties.
 ;;CODE^9221^DEEP SEDATION/GENERAL ANESTHESIA - EACH ADDITIONAL 15 MINUTES 
 ;;SVC^6^15^525.9
 ;;NOP^@
 ;;USE
 ;;Anesthesia time begins when the doctor administering the anesthetic agent initiates the
 ;;appropriate anesthesia and non-invasive monitoring protocol and remains in continuous attendance
 ;;of the patient.  Anesthesia services are considered completed when the patient may be safely left
 ;;under the observation of trained personnel and the doctor may safely leave the room to attend to
 ;;other patients or duties.  
 ;;CODE^9241^INTRAVENOUS CONSCIOUS SEDATION/ANALGESIA - FIRST 30 MINUTES
 ;;SVC^5^30^525.9
 ;;NOP^n
 ;;USE
 ;;Anesthesia time begins when the doctor administering the anesthetic agent initiates
 ;;the appropriate anesthesia and non-invasive monitoring protocol and remains in continuous
 ;;attendance of the patient.  Anesthesia services are considered completed when the patient
 ;;may be safely left under the observation of trained personnel and the doctor may safely
 ;;leave the room to attend to other patients or duties
 ;;CODE^9242^INTRAVENOUS CONSCIOUS SEDATION/ANALGESIA - EACH ADDITIONAL 15 MINUTES
 ;;SVC^5^15^525.9
 ;;NOP^@
 ;;USE
 ;;Anesthesia time begins when the doctor administering the anesthetic agent initiates
 ;;the appropriate anesthesia and non-invasive monitoring protocol and remains in
 ;;continuous attendance of the patient.  Anesthesia services are considered completed
