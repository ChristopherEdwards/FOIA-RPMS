 ;;CODE^4266^GUIDED TISSUE REGENERATION - RESORBABLE BARRIER, PER SITE
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;A membrane is placed over the root surfaces or defect area following surgical exposure and debridement. The mucoperiosteal flaps are then adapted over the membrane and sutured. The membrane is placed to exclude epithelium and gingival connective tissue
 ;;from the healing wound. This procedure may require subsequent surgical procedures to correct the gingival contours. Guided tissue regeneration may also be carried out in conjunction with bone replacement grafts or to correct deformities resulting from
 ;;inadequate faciolingual bone width in an edentulous area. When guided tissue regeneration is used in association with a tooth, each site on a specific tooth should be reported separately with this code. When no tooth is present, each site should be
 ;;reported separately.  Definition for the term "site" precedes code D4210.
 ;;CODE^4267^GUIDED TISSUE REGENERATION - NONRESORBABLE BARRIER, PER SITE, (INCLUDES MEMBRANE REMOVAL)
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;This procedure is used to regenerate lost or injured periodontal tissue by directing differential tissue responses. A membrane is placed over the root surfaces or defect area following surgical exposure and debridement. The mucoperiosteal flaps are then
 ;;a
 ;;CODE^4268^SURGICAL REVISION PROCEDURE, PER TOOTH
 ;;MNE^SR
 ;;SVC^6^15^2842
 ;;SYN^SURG REV
 ;;USE
 ;;This procedure is to refine the results of a previously provided surgical procedure.  This may require a surgical procedure to modify the irregular contours of hard or soft tissue.  A mucoperiosteal flap may be elevated to allow access to reshape
 ;;alveolar bone.  The flaps are replaced or repositioned and sutured.
 ;;CODE^4341^PERIODONTAL SCALING AND ROOT PLANING, PER QUADRANT
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;This procedure involves instrumentation of the crown and root surfaces of the teeth to remove plaque and calculus from these surfaces. It is indicated for patients with periodontal disease and is therapeutic, not prophylactic, in nature. Root planing is
 ;;the definitive procedure designed for the removal of cementum and dentin that is rough, and/or permeated by calculus or contaminated with toxins or microorganisms. Some soft tissue removal occurs. This procedure may be used as a definitive treatment in
 ;;some stages of periodontal disease and/or as a part of pre-surgical procedures in others.
 ;;CODE^4910^PERIODONTAL MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES (FOLLOWING ACTIVE THERAPY)
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;This procedure is for patients who have completed periodontal treatment (surgical and/or nonsurgical  periodontal therapies exclusive of D4355) and includes removal of the bacterial flora from crevicular and pocket areas, scaling and polishing of the
 ;;teeth, periodontal evaluation, and a review of the patient's plaque control efficiency. Typically, an interval of three months between appointments results in an effective treatment schedule, but this can vary depending upon the clinical judgment of the
 ;;dentist. When new or recurring periodontal disease appears, additional diagnostic and treatment procedures must be considered. Periodic maintenance treatment following periodontal therapy is not synonymous with a prophylaxis.
 ;;CODE^5140^IMMEDIATE DENTURE - MANDIBULAR
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;Includes limited follow-up care only; does not include required future rebasing/relining procedure(s) or a complete new denture.
 ;;CODE^5211^MAXILLARY PARTIAL DENTURE - RESIN BASE (INCLUDING ANY CONVENTIONAL CLASPS, RESTS AND TEETH)
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;Includes acrylic resin base denture with resin or wrought wire clasps.
 ;;CODE^5850^TISSUE CONDITIONING, MAXILLARY
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;Treatment reline using materials designed to heal unhealthy ridges prior to more definitive final restoration.
 ;;CODE^5851^TISSUE CONDITIONING, MANDIBULAR
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;Treatment reline using materials designed to heal unhealthy ridges prior to more definitive final restoration.
 ;;CODE^5861^OVERDENTURE - PARTIAL, BY REPORT
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;Describe and document procedures as performed. Other separate procedures may be required concurrent to D5861.
 ;;CODE^5867^REPLACEMENT OF REPLACEABLE PART OF SEMI-PRECISION OR PRECISION ATTACHMENT (MALE OR FEMALE COMPONENT)
 ;;MNE^RPA
 ;;SVC^6^20^2851
 ;;SYN^REP ATTACH
 ;;USE
 ;;
 ;;CODE^5875^MODIFICATION OF REMOVABLE PROSTHESIS FOLLOWING IMPLANT SURGERY
 ;;MNE^MRP
 ;;SVC^6^20^2851
 ;;SYN^MOD REM PROS
 ;;USE
 ;;The modification of existing removable prosthesis is sometimes necessary at the time of implant placement and bone graft surgery and is always necessary at the time of the placement of the healing caps.  This code could also be used to report the
 ;;modification of an existing prosthesis when the abutments are placed and retentive elements are placed into the removable prosthesis, thereby reducing the need for a new prosthesis.
 ;;CODE^6020^ABUTMENT PLACEMENT OR SUBSTITUTION: ENDOSTEAL IMPLANT
 ;;SVC^^
 ;;USE
 ;;An abutment is placed to permit fabrication of a dental prosthesis. This procedure may include the removal of a temporary healing cap or replacement with an abutment of alternate design. The intention of this code is to report this procedure by other
 ;;than the dentist who placed the implant.
