 ;;Electrodiagnostic medicine is the medical subspecialty that applies 
 ;;neurophysiologic techniques to diagnose, evaluate, and treat patients 
 ;;with impairments of the neurologic, neuromuscular, and/or muscular 
 ;;systems. Qualified physicians are trained in performing 
 ;;electrophysiological testing and interpretation of the test data. They 
 ;;require knowledge in anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, histology, and 
 ;;pathology of the brain, spinal cord, autonomic nerves, cranial nerves, 
 ;;peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and muscles. They must know 
 ;;clinical features and treatment of diseases of the central, peripheral, 
 ;;and autonomic nervous systems, as well as those of neuromuscular junction 
 ;;and muscle. Physicians also require special knowledge about electric 
 ;;signal processing, including waveform analysis, electronics and 
 ;;instrumentation, stimulation and recording equipment, and statistics.
