^DG(48,5,"C",1,0)="This version of MAS contains the partial redesign of the PATIENT file which"
^DG(48,5,"C",2,0)="moves all data that was in the ADMISSION multiple of the PATIENT file into"
^DG(48,5,"C",3,0)="the new PATIENT MOVEMENT file (#405).  This will allow for a flat structure"
^DG(48,5,"C",4,0)="as opposed to the multiple structure which existed. "
^DG(48,5,"C",5,0)=" "
^DG(48,5,"C",6,0)="There are three main components to the conversion process.  In addition to"
^DG(48,5,"C",7,0)="the movement of inpatient episodes from the multiple in the PATIENT file"
^DG(48,5,"C",8,0)="to the PATIENT MOVEMENT file, there will also be a restructuring of the way"
^DG(48,5,"C",9,0)="beds and movement types are stored."
^DG(48,5,"C",10,0)=" "
^DG(48,5,"C",11,0)="The movement types which were in the ADMISSION TYPE, DISCHARGE"
^DG(48,5,"C",12,0)="TYPE, and TRANSFER TYPE files will now be moved into a single file called"
^DG(48,5,"C",13,0)="the FACILITY MOVEMENT TYPE file.  The entries which were previously in the"
^DG(48,5,"C",14,0)="MOVEMENT TYPE file (a file of MAS determined movement types) have been"
^DG(48,5,"C",15,0)="moved to the new MAS MOVEMENT TYPE file where many additional movement types"
^DG(48,5,"C",16,0)="have also been added."
^DG(48,5,"C",17,0)=" "
^DG(48,5,"C",18,0)="In addition, the present room-bed structure has been modified.  In prior"
^DG(48,5,"C",19,0)="versions, the WARD LOCATION file contained a multiple of ROOMs which"
^DG(48,5,"C",20,0)="contained a multiple of BEDS.  In the new design, there will be a file of"
^DG(48,5,"C",21,0)="ROOM-BEDs (file 405.4) which will contain a multiple called WARD(S) WHICH"
^DG(48,5,"C",22,0)="CAN ASSIGN.  This will allow for more accurate bed availability.  A bed"
^DG(48,5,"C",23,0)="can now be 'shared' by two wards.  Once one ward utilizes that bed, it will"
^DG(48,5,"C",24,0)="no longer be available for selection by the second ward.  Beginning with"
^DG(48,5,"C",25,0)="this version, the lodger process has been automated and lodgers will also"
^DG(48,5,"C",26,0)="be assigned beds and will, therefore, be included when determining bed"
^DG(48,5,"C",27,0)="availability."
^DG(48,5,"C",28,0)=" "
^DG(48,5,"C",29,0)="Due to these changes, a large percentage of the MAS package has been"
^DG(48,5,"C",30,0)="rewritten to conform to the new file structures.  Many of these changes"
^DG(48,5,"C",31,0)="will appear transparent to the user, but some options will appear quite"
^DG(48,5,"C",32,0)="different due to changes necessary because of the redesign and changes"
^DG(48,5,"C",33,0)="included at the request of the MAS SIUG and MAS users in the field."

^DG(48,5,"C",48,0)=" "
^DG(48,5,"C",49,0)="Also changed is the OTHER ENTITLED ELIGIBILITIES multiple "
^DG(48,5,"C",50,0)="in the PATIENT file.  The name of the multiple has been "
^DG(48,5,"C",51,0)="changed to PATIENT ELIGIBILIIES. This multiple will now "
^DG(48,5,"C",52,0)="contain all the patient's eligibilities.  Previously, the "
^DG(48,5,"C",53,0)="patient's primary eligibility was not stored in this "
^DG(48,5,"C",54,0)="multiple.  Long and short identifications are also stored in "
^DG(48,5,"C",55,0)="the multiple for each of the eligibility codes."
