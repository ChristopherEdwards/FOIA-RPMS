 ; thawed plasma unit #W040713210843 the patient developed a rash and itching.  Th
 ;;e entire unit had been transfused.  There were only minor changes in his VS: T 98.3 to 98.2; HR 56 to 56; BP 119/71 to 132/75 and
 ; RR 18 to 18.  Blood Bank was notified of a suspected transfusion reaction.  A clerical check revealed no errors; the patient&ap
 ;;os;s posttransfusion plasma was not hemolyzed and his direct antiglobulin tesst (DAT) remained negative.  The patient's symptoms
 ; and the lack of laboratory findings are most conististent with a mild allergic transfusion reaction.  Such reactions are not uncommon
 ; and are usually directed to foreign proteins in the transfused plasma to which the recipient is immune.  If future transfusions are
 ; needed premedication with benadryl may be beneficial."/>
